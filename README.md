# Advent of Code 2022

My off-the-top-of-my-head solutions for the 2022 AoC.
This repo is based on the template available at https://github.com/ohaz/advent-of-code-base.

## Requirements

These scripts require python 3.10 to run, as some features introduced in that version are used.

### Installing

To install the requirements run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running

To run all days, just run:

`python main.py`

To run just one day, run:

`python main.py <number_of_day>`, e.g. `python main.py 11`
